Welcome!

Moojic a basic prototype of a music application that let's us upload and stream music.

Prerequisites to use this app:
Python3, Django 1.8 (any later version of Django will work not work), pip

If you do not have either of the two(Python/Django), follow the instructions from this page: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/howto/windows/
To install pip, run the command: easy_install pip

Once you have all the requirements follow these steps to start using the application:
Step1: Open Powershell (terminal for Mac/Linux) as admin
Step2: cd to the "website" directory
Step3: run command: python manage.py runserver (sudo python manage.py runserver - for Mac/Linux users)
Step4: Open browser and enter the ip address - http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Step5: Start using the app!
